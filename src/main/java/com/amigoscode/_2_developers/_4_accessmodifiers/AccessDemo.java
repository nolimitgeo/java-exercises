        //  Hint: think about what 'private' means for field visibility outside the class.

        // The reason why the line aforementioned (instance.secret ...) would not work
        // is due to the instance variable being private.
        // Because it is private, it can only be accessed directly inside the AccessModifiers class.
        // This is why we use 'getters' and 'setters', because these are methods WITHIN its scope.
